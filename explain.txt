			let's assume blue ball's location is #00b1 , red ball's location is #00b2.
			
			Java method's argument will copy the references coming in, and then locate it to NEW postion.
			so, Argument b1's location would be #00a1, b2 would be #00a2. 
			#00a1 pointing to blue ball. 
			#00a2 pointing to red ball.
      
      color will be changed. because this copied reference still pointing to same object which is blue ball.
		  #00a1(#00b1)'s color changed - green. 
    
      but 
    
      swap won't work. because they swap copied references each other. not original one.

			#00a1 : red ball. 
			#00a2 : green ball
			
			but still. 
			#00b1 : green ball
			#00b2 : red ball.
